      <h1>About priceTracker</h1>
      <p>
        priceTracker is a powerful, user-friendly macOS application designed to keep you informed about the latest stock and cryptocurrency prices in real time. Completely free to use, it updates every minute to ensure you always have the most accurate and up-to-date market information at your fingertips. Whether you're a seasoned trader or just starting your investment journey, priceTracker is a reliable companion for staying on top of the markets effortlessly. This program will be indefinitely hosted on github due to Apple's lack of privacy for small developers who utilize their app store.
